	<dd> <i> Augmented Reality </i> is the blending of Virtual Reality and real life. AR is using technology to superimpose information such as sounds, images, and text on the real world that we can see. <br> AR is not a new technology. It was used in display panels of fighter aircraft in the 1990s. In 2009, Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed SixthSense ; a small device worn like a pendant, and combines the use of camera, projector, smartphone and mirror. </dd> <br>

	<dd> In <I> Virtual Reality </I>, we create a virtual world that users can interact with. In this world, the user cannot easily distinguish between what is real and virtual. <br> 
	In both VR/AR, people must wear HMD (Head Mounted Displays) or a VR headset like Oculus Rfit or the Google Cardboard. Both AR & VR provide a tool immersive experience to the user. This technology is used in education. Imagine being in a historical battle, you can really feel the battle and touch the organs. </dd> </dl> <br>
